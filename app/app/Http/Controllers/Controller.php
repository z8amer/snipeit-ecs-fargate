 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This documentation is designed to allow developers to easily understand
 * the backend code of Snipe-IT. Familiarity with the PHP language is assumed,
 * and experience with the Laravel framework (version 5.2) will be very helpful.
 *
 * **THIS DOCUMENTATION DOES NOT COVER INSTALLATION.** If you're here and you're not a
 * developer, you're probably in the wrong place. Please see the
 * [Installation documentation](https://snipe-it.readme.io) for
 * information on how to install Snipe-IT.
 *
 * To learn how to set up a development environment and get started developing for Snipe-IT,
 * please see the [contributing documentation](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/contributing-overview).
 *
 * Only the Snipe-IT specific controllers, models, helpers, service providers,
 * etc have been included in this documentation (excluding vendors, Laravel core, etc)
 * for simplicity.
